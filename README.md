# Ecommerce Purchases Data Analysis

This project is a simple data analysis of ecommerce purchase records using Python. The goal is to understand customer behavior, demographics, and spending habits through various queries and filters.

## About the Project

The dataset contains information like job titles, email providers, languages, and purchase amounts. Using pandas and basic Python, we answer questions like:

- What’s the average purchase price?
- Who are the high spenders?
- Which job titles or email providers are most common?
- Are there users with American Express cards expiring in 2025?

## What's Inside

- `Ecommerce_Purchases.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all the analysis and answers.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Seaborn/Matplotlib for any visual checks

## How to Use

You can open the notebook using Jupyter and run the cells to see all the questions and solutions step by step.

No advanced setup is needed—just basic Python and Jupyter or vscode.

## Summary

This is a good beginner-friendly project to practice data filtering, grouping, and logical querying in pandas. It helps build confidence in working with real-world datasets.
